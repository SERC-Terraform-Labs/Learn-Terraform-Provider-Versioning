# Learn Terraform Provider Versioning

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/.../...)

This repo is a companion repo to the [Lock and Upgrade Provider Versions Learn guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/provider-versioning), containing Terraform configuration files to provision a S3 bucket.

**Do not** clone the Learn Terraform Provider Versioning repository. You can skip that step as the files are already included here.

This tutorial uses AWS S3 bucket. It should be free to create the bucket, but I'm not sure about this. To be safe, skip the `terraform apply` steps.

Add changes to version control as you go through the steps in the tutorial. This will make it easier to see which configuration settings have changed.
